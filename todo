which part of a chicken is called a nuget
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
A chicken "nugget" is not an actual part of a chicken. It is a processed food item made from deboned chicken meat. Typically, chicken nuggets are made by grinding or mincing chicken meat (which can include breast, thigh, or other parts), mixing it with seasonings and binders, shaping it into nugget-sized portions, and then breading and frying or baking them.

The term "nugget" refers to the small, bite-sized shape, not a specific anatomical part of the chicken.
